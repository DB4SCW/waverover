This tool helps first-time users to migrate their logs to Wavelog. Import ADIF files into Wavelog with automatic station location management. The tool detects unique station locations from your ADIF records, creates missing station profiles in Wavelog, and imports QSOs to the correct profile.

> **Warning:** Make sure the rate limits on your Wavelog instance are set high enough before importing.

## Usage

```
waveRover -url <url> -key <key> [options] <file.adi> [file2.adi ...]
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-url` | — | Wavelog base URL (or set `WAVELOG_URL`) |
| `-key` | — | Wavelog API key, read+write (or set `WAVELOG_API_KEY`) |
| `-dry-run` | false | Parse and show what would happen, but don't import |
| `-match-fields` | `STATION_CALLSIGN,MY_GRIDSQUARE` | Comma-separated ADIF fields that define a unique station location |
| `-name-format` | — | Profile name template with `{FIELD}` placeholders from match fields, e.g. `"{STATION_CALLSIGN} @ {MY_SOTA}"`. Empty: name is built automatically from all match field values |
| `-grid-precision` | `6` | Grid locator precision for grouping. `6` = full grid square, `4` = grid field only |

### Getting your API key

In Wavelog: User Menu → API → Create Key (read+write required).

## Examples

### Basic import

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 my_log.adi
```

### Dry run first (recommended)

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 -dry-run my_log.adi
```

Output shows all detected station locations and QSO counts without touching Wavelog.

### Multiple ADIF files

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 lotw_export.adi clublog.adi
```

### Import a LoTW export

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 ~/Downloads/lotw_exp.adi
```

LoTW exports are handled automatically — see [LoTW special handling](#lotw-special-handling) below.

### Broader grouping with 4-character grids

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 -grid-precision 4 my_log.adi
```

Groups QSOs by 4-char grid field (e.g. `JO30`) instead of 6-char square (e.g. `JO30OO`). Grids in the imported QSOs are truncated to match.

### Match on additional fields (SOTA, POTA, etc.)

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 \
  -match-fields "STATION_CALLSIGN,MY_GRIDSQUARE,MY_SOTA" my_log.adi
```

QSOs with the same callsign and grid but different SOTA references are treated as separate station locations. Any ADIF `MY_*` field is supported: `MY_SOTA`, `MY_POTA`, `MY_WWFF`, `MY_SIG`, `MY_SIG_INFO`, `MY_CITY`, `MY_IOTA`, `MY_STATE`, etc.

### Profile naming

By default, new station profiles are named from all match field values: the first value, then `@`, then the rest. With the match fields above, a profile becomes e.g. `DL1ABC @ JO30OO DM/RP-001`.

Use `-name-format` to define your own scheme with `{FIELD}` placeholders (match fields only):

```
waveRover -url https://log.example.com -key abc123 \
  -match-fields "STATION_CALLSIGN,MY_SOTA" \
  -name-format "SOTA {MY_SOTA} ({STATION_CALLSIGN})" my_log.adi
```

Creates profiles like `SOTA DM/RP-001 (DL1ABC)`. Placeholders referencing fields not listed in `-match-fields` produce a warning and stay empty.

### Using environment variables

```
export WAVELOG_URL=https://log.example.com
export WAVELOG_API_KEY=abc123
waveRover my_log.adi
```

## Re-running and duplicates

The tool is idempotent — you can safely re-import the same ADIF file. QSOs that already exist in Wavelog are detected as duplicates and skipped. The summary at the end lists each duplicate by callsign, band, mode, date, and time:

```
=== Summary ===
Imported: 17950
Duplicates skipped: 10

Duplicates:
  W1AW 20M FT8 20260515 142300
  DL2XYZ 40M CW 20260516 080100
  ...
```

If a batch contains a mix of new and duplicate QSOs, the new ones are imported and only the duplicates are skipped.

## LoTW special handling

When importing an ADIF from [ARRL Logbook of the World](https://lotw.arrl.org/), the tool applies several transforms automatically:

**Field conversion:**
- `APP_LoTW_RXQSL` (LoTW QSL received timestamp) is converted to ADIF-compliant `LOTW_QSLRDATE` + `LOTW_QSL_RCVD=Y`
- `APP_LoTW_RXQSO` (LoTW QSO insert timestamp) is converted to `LOTW_QSLSDATE` + `LOTW_QSL_SENT=Y`
- Date format is converted from LoTW format (`2026-05-20 10:46:46`) to ADIF format (`20260520`)

**QSL field cleanup:**
- `QSL_RCVD` and `QSLRDATE` are stripped from LoTW exports — their content simply sets QSL_RCVD (meant for paper) regardless if there's a paper-QSL or not.

**RST defaults:**
- Missing `RST_SENT` and `RST_RCVD` are filled based on mode: `59` for phone (SSB, FM, AM, USB, LSB), `599` for CW, `0` for digital modes (FT8, RTTY, etc.)

These transforms only apply when LoTW-specific fields are detected, so regular ADIF files are left unchanged.

### A word on LoTW Exports

Importing ADIF files generated by LoTW (Logbook of The World) exports is **not recommended**. LoTW's export format has several limitations that cause data loss:

- **QSL information is overwritten** — LoTW marks every confirmed QSO with `QSL_RCVD="Y"`, which in most logging software indicates a *paper QSL card* was received. This incorrectly sets QSL status and loses the distinction between LoTW confirmation and physical card confirmation.
- **RST is lost** — LoTW exports do not include sent/received signal reports (RST), so imported QSOs will be missing this data.
- **Duplicate risk** — Re-importing LoTW confirmations on top of existing QSOs can create duplicates or overwrite manually maintained QSL records.

If you need LoTW confirmation data, it's better to match against your own log (e.g. using Wavelog's LoTW sync) rather than importing raw LoTW exports.

Note the following version requirements:

- **Wavelog 2.4.3 or later** is required for matching beyond callsign and grid square. Newer versions support additional match criteria (xOTA, WWFF, SIG/SIG_INFO).
- **Wavelog below 2.4.3** only supports matching by callsign and grid square.

## How it works

1. Parses all ADIF files and extracts QSO records
2. Groups QSOs by unique station locations (default: callsign + grid square)
3. Fetches existing station profiles from Wavelog
4. For each location:
   - Matches against existing profiles (callsign, grid, and any additional match fields)
   - Creates a new station profile if no match is found (named from the match field values, or your `-name-format` template)
   - Imports all QSOs in 1MB chunks
5. If a chunk contains duplicates, parses the API response to identify which QSOs are dupes, imports the remaining QSOs individually
6. Prints a summary with counts and details for any duplicates or errors
